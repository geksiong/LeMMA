LeMMA - a GUI frontend for creating MMA files

Note that this is NOT really an MMA editor, but rather a simple front-end to generate simple MMA files. I wrote this program so that I can churn out and play chord progressions easily.

INSTALLATION
------------
1. Windows:

Just unzip the files to any directory and run lemma.pyw or lemma.py

2. Linux:

Run install.py which will install to /usr/local

You can also use the command-line option --prefix=/usr to install to /usr

Or you can just unzip the files to a user directory and run lemma.py directly

Note that if you install to /usr or /usr/local, the configuration files will be saved in ~/.lemma. This can be overriden with the the --config option when starting LeMMA.

To uninstall LeMMA manually, delete the file <your install dir>/bin/lemma and the directory <your install dir>/share/lemma

USAGE
